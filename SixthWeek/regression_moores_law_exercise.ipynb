    "Objective: Moore's law states that the number of transistors doubles every $m$ months (for comparable processors). We want to understand this and determine the exact number of months $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guide:\n",
    "- First plot the number of transistors as a function of the year. This shows the exponential growth.\n",
    "- Look at the number of transistors on a logarithmic scale (or explicitly compute the logarithm of the number of transistors before plotting).\n",
    "- Model this data with a linear regression line and determine the slope of the regression line.\n",
    "- Determine the information you are looking for from the slope. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Mathematical hint:\n",
    "If you model the logarithmized $y$-values as a function of the $x$-values (for the sake of simplicity directly to the base $2$), this means\n",
    "$$\\log_2(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion to $y$ gives:\n",
    "$$y = 2^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x} = 2^{\\beta_0} \\cdot 2^{\\beta_1 \\cdot x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you increase $x$ by one unit (in this case one year), $y$ (in this case the number of transistors) increases by a factor of $2^{\\beta_1}$.\n",
    "Or if you increase $x$ by $\\frac{1}{\\beta_1}$, y increases by a factor of 2. How large is $\\frac{1}{\\beta_1}$?)"
